# Alpaca API Configuration
# Copy this file to config.py and add your real API keys

# Get your API keys from: https://app.alpaca.markets/paper/dashboard/overview
API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
SECRET_KEY = "your_secret_key_here"

# Base URL for API calls
# Paper trading (recommended for learning):
BASE_URL = "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets"

# Live trading (use only when ready and tested):
# BASE_URL = "https://api.alpaca.markets"

# IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:
# 1. NEVER commit config.py to Git (it's in .gitignore)
# 2. NEVER share your API keys with anyone
# 3. Start with paper trading until you're confident
# 4. You can regenerate keys anytime at alpaca.markets if compromised
